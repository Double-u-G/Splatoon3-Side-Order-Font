# Spaltoon3-SideOrderFont
This is a mostly custom recreation of the Font used in Splatoon 3 Side Order. I got my hands on an incomplete version of the Font and added symbols and missing letters to it, so it was completely usable.
This Font is Fanmade and not officail. Nintendo still owns the rights to thsi fonts, because of the orignal letters which are used

One can use this Font how they want.
There is no need to credit me (Double_u_G):

Made by Nintendo.
