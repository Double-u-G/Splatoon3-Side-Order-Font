# Spaltoon3-SideOrderFont
This is a mostly custom recreation of the Font used in Splatoon 3 Side Order. I got my hands on an incomplete version of the Font and added symbols and missing letters to it.
This Font is Fan made and not official. Nintendo still owns the rights to this font, because of the original letters which are used.

One can use this Font how they want.
There is no need to credit me (Double_u_G):

Made by Nintendo.
